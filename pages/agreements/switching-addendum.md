Applicable to EU-based customers on all plans.

:::

This Switching Addendum (this “**Addendum**”) is supplemental to, and forms part of, the written agreement between Retool, Inc. ("**Retool**") and Customer that governs Customer's use of the Services (the "**Agreement**"). If there is conflict between this Addendum and the Agreement, this Addendum will prevail solely with respect to the conflict.

## 1. Definitions.

- “**EU Data Act**” means Regulation (EU) 2023/2854.
- “**Exportable Data**” has the meaning ascribed to it in the EU Data Act and, for the purposes of this Addendum, includes the data identified in Schedule 1 of this Addendum. “Exportable Data” excludes Usage Information, any data protected by intellectual property rights or constituting trade secrets, and data related to the integrity and security of the Retool Data Processing Service.
- “**Retool Data Processing Service**” means the Retool-hosted, multi-tenant version of the Services made available by Retool to Customer under an Order Form or otherwise.
- “**Switch Notice Period**” means the two-month period following Retool’s receipt of Customer’s Switch Notice.
- “**Transitional Period**” means the period following expiration of the Switch Notice Period during which the Switching process takes place.
- The terms “on-premises ICT infrastructure,” “data processing service,” “switching,” and “switching charge” will have the meanings ascribed to them under the EU Data Act.
- All other capitalized terms used in this Addendum but not otherwise defined above will have the meanings given to them in the Agreement.

## 2. Applicability and Scope.

**2.1** This Addendum applies only if (A) Customer is using the Retool Data Processing Service and (B) Customer’s billing address, as specified in Customer’s Order Form (or, if Customer did not execute an Order Form to purchase its subscription to the Retool Data Processing Service, as associated with Customer’s Retool account), is located in the European Union or the European Economic Area. This Addendum will not apply to migrations from the Retool Data Processing Service to the version of the Services which Customer may host on its own infrastructure.

## 3. Switch Notice.

**3.1** If Customer intends to (A) initiate the Switching process with respect to the Retool Data Processing Service or (B) only erase its Exportable Data without Switching, Customer must provide two months’ written notice to its Retool account manager (such notice being a “**Switch Notice**”), which will include, if Customer intends to Switch to a new data processing service, the name of such service and its provider.

## 4. Erasure of Exportable Data.

**4.1. Applicability.** This Section 4 will apply if the Switch Notice specifies that Customer intends to only erase its Exportable Data without Switching to another data processing service or porting Exportable Data to an on-premises ICT infrastructure.

**4.2. Deletion of Exportable Data.** The Retool Data Processing Service includes self-serve features and functionality that enable Customer to delete or export Exportable Data at any time during a subscription term. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer may use such self-serve features to exercise its right to erase Exportable Data under the EU Data Act.

**4.3. Termination.** The Agreement may be terminated after the end of the Switch Notice Period, provided that Customer must provide written notice of termination to its Retool account manager. Retool will promptly confirm termination upon receipt of Customer’s notice. Section 6 (Early Termination Penalties) will apply for any early termination of the Agreement that occurs under this section.

## 5. Switching.

**5.1. Applicability.** This Section 5 will apply if the Switch Notice specifies that Customer intends to either Switch to a data processing service provided by a different provider or port Exportable Data to an on-premises ICT infrastructure.

**5.2. Retool Obligations.** To support Customer’s exit strategy relevant to the Retool Data Processing Service, Retool will, during the Transitional Period: (A) provide reasonable support to Customer in the Switching process by making available self-serve features and functionality in the Retool Data Processing Service that enable Customer to export the Exportable Data; (B) continue Retool’s provision of the Retool Data Processing Service and performance of its other obligations in accordance with the Agreement; (C) provide information concerning known risks to continuity in the provision of the Retool Data Processing Service, if any; and (D) maintain at least the same or higher level of security as set forth in the Security Practices Page throughout the Switching process.

**5.3. Customer Responsibilities.** Customer will be responsible for exporting the Exportable Data from the Retool Data Processing Service and transforming such data for use with Customer’s systems or with the data processing service of the new provider. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Retool is not required to develop new technologies or new data processing services in order to guarantee functional equivalence in an environment other than Retool’s own systems.

**5.4. Duration.** The Transitional Period will last for a period of thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration of the Switch Notice Period. Customer will have a one-time right to request an extension of the Transitional Period. Retool must receive Customer’s extension request, including the desired extension period, before the Transitional Period expires.

**5.5. Deletion of Exportable Data.** Retool will retain Exportable Data for a period of thirty (30) calendar days after the Transitional Period expires (such period being the “**Retrieval Period**”). At the end of the Retrieval Period and upon Customer’s request, Retool will delete all Exportable Data, except for the Exportable Data which Retool is obligated to store under applicable laws.

**5.6. Termination.** The Agreement may be terminated when Customer completes the Switching process, provided that it must provide written notice of termination to its Retool account manager. Retool will promptly confirm termination upon receipt of Customer’s notice. Section 6 (Early Termination Penalties) will apply for any early termination of the Agreement that occurs under this section.

## 6. Early Termination Penalties.

**6.1.** If Customer’s exercise of its rights under Section 4 or Section 5 of this Addendum results in the early termination of Customer’s then applicable Order Form or subscription term, the following will apply:

- **6.1.1.** Customer will not be entitled to any refund of any prepaid fees;
- **6.1.2.** Any unpaid fees, including those for the remaining years in the Order Form after the effective date of termination, will be immediately due and payable by Customer to Retool; and
- **6.1.3** In no event will any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any fees payable to Retool for the period prior to the effective date of termination.

**6.2.** The parties acknowledge and agree that any remaining fees owed by Customer under the Order Form will not be considered as a Switching Charge.
