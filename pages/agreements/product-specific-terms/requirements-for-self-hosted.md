Applicable to customers on any plan.

:::

These Requirements for Self-Hosted Deployments (“Requirements”) apply to customers who deploy and host the Services on their own infrastructure (“Self-Hosted Services”). These Requirements are supplemental to, and form part of, the Retool Master Subscription Agreement or other written agreement between Retool, Inc. (“Retool”) and Customer that governs Customer’s use of the Services (in either case, the “Agreement”). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in these Requirements will have the meanings given to them in the Agreement.

## 1. Network requirements

**1.1** Customer must comply with all virtual machine, network, and other requirements specified in the Documentation for the Self-Hosted Services.


## 2. License Verification

**2.1** Customer will (i) permit Retool to verify Customer’s compliance with the authorized scope of use for the Self-Hosted Services set forth in the current Order Form; or (ii) upon Retool’s request, provide written verification to Retool that demonstrates such compliance. Such written verification will be in the form of a report generated by the Self-Hosted Services or other form that is reasonably necessary for Retool to verify Customer’s compliance. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order Form, if Customer has exceeded its authorized scope of use for the Self-Hosted Services and, upon Retool’s request, does not use good-faith efforts to resolve or address such excess use with Retool, Retool may invoice Customer the fees applicable to such  use. Customer will pay any amounts invoiced by Retool under this section in accordance with the payment terms in the Agreement.
