Applicable to customers on any plan.

AI-Enabled Applications and Customer Agents are powered by Third-Party Models. Customer will have the option to choose its desired Third-Party Model and Customer must comply with the terms and policies applicable to such Third-Party Model (“**Third-Party Model Policies**”). Third-Party Model Policies may be updated from time to time by the provider of the applicable model. Retool may suspend its provision of Retool AI if Retool reasonably believes that Customer is in breach of any Third-Party Model Policies.
