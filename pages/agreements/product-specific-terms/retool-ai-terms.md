Applicable to customers on any plan.

:::

These Retool AI Terms ("**AI Terms**") contain terms and conditions that apply to Customer's use of Retool AI (as defined below), and are supplemental to, and form part of, the [Terms of Service](https://docs.retool.com/legal/customer-terms-of-service), [Master Subscription Agreement](https://docs.retool.com/legal/master-subscription-agreement), or other written agreement between Retool, Inc. ("**Retool**") and Customer that governs Customer's use of the Services (the "**Agreement**"). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in these AI Terms will have the meanings given to them in the Agreement. Retool AI will be deemed part of the Services under the Agreement.

## 1. Definitions

- "**Retool AI**" means Retool's suite of developer tools, features, and products that enable Customer to build AI-Enabled Applications. "Retool AI" will include the Agents Platform.
- “**Agent Data**” means (i) all natural language instructions and prompts that Customer submits to the Agents Platform to configure a Customer Agent; and (ii) information submitted to or accessed, received, or used by a Customer Agent in connection with completing a task, including End User Input and Tool Output.
- “**Agents Platform**” means Retool’s platform for configuring and deploying Customer Agents, which includes features that enable Customer to test, evaluate, and monitor the ongoing performance of its Customer Agents and End User Outputs.
- "**AI-Enabled Application**" means a Custom App that incorporates  features or functionality powered by a Supported LLM. The term "AI-Enabled Application" will include Customer Agents.
- "**Custom App**" means any application, workflow, or process that is customized, programmed, or developed by Customer using the Services, including any AI-Enabled Applications.
- "**Customer Agent**" means an AI-powered system developed and deployed by Customer using the Agents Platform that uses LLM reasoning to automate the performance and completion of specific tasks on Customer's behalf.
- “**End User Input**” means any data, information, input, or prompt that an end user submits to an AI-Enabled Application.
- "**End User Output**" means any information and other content generated and returned to the end user of an AI-Enabled Application based on the End User Input and, if applicable, Agent Data. 
- “**Supported LLM**” means any of the large language models that Customer may use for its AI-Enabled Application, as set forth in the applicable Documentation.
- "**Tool Output**" means any information or data returned to a Customer Agent as the result of calling a tool which Customer has connected to its Customer Agent. 

## 2. Supported LLMs

AI-Enabled Applications and Customer Agents are powered by Supported LLMs, which may be used with Retool’s API keys (a “**Retool-Managed LLM**”) or Customer’s own API keys (“**Customer-Managed LLM**”).
If Customer elects to use a Retool-Managed LLM, Customer must comply with the [usage policies and requirements](https://docs.retool.com/legal/retool-managed-LLM-policies) of the provider of the Retool-Managed LLM ("**Retool-Managed LLM Policies**"). Retool may suspend Customer's use of a Retool-Managed LLM if Retool reasonably believes that Customer is in breach of the applicable Retool-Managed LLM Policies. If reasonable under the circumstances, Retool will notify Customer in advance of any suspension and may provide Customer an opportunity to remediate the issue.

## 3. Customer's Responsibilities

**3.1 End User Input.** Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, appropriateness, and legality of all End User Input submitted to AI-Enabled Applications. Customer will not permit end users of AI-Enabled Applications to submit End User Input that are intended to generate, or would reasonably be expected to generate, End User Output that is unlawful, harmful, or infringes, violates, or misappropriates the rights of any third party.

**3.2 Compliance With Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy.** Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer controls how it uses Retool AI. As such: 

**3.2.1** Customer represents and warrants that its use cases for Retool AI will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those applying to artificial intelligence, data protection, intellectual property, and export controls; 

**3.2.2** Customer will not use Retool AI to build and deploy AI-Enabled Applications for (i) "prohibited" or "high-risk" activities under the EU AI ACT or other similar equivalent laws and regulations; or (ii) discriminatory, deceptive, or harmful purposes. Customer will also comply with the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://docs.retool.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy), as it may be updated by Retool from time to time; and

**3.2.3** Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that any legally required disclosures are made to its end users regarding the use of artificial intelligence features or systems within its AI-Enabled Applications. Customer will not mislead any person that End User Output was solely human-generated or conceal the fact that an end user of an AI-Enabled Application or Customer Agent is interacting with artificial intelligence.

**3.3 Agents Platform.** 

**3.3.1 Customer Responsibilities.** Customer will be solely responsible for: (i) using the features of the Agents Platform to regularly monitor and assess a Customer Agent’s performance and its End User Output; (ii)  following Retool’s best practices for configuring and operating a Customer Agent, as set forth in the applicable Documentation (“**Agent Best Practices**”); (iii) determining whether a Customer Agent’s actions and behaviors and returned End User Output are lawful and appropriate for its use case; and (iv) any End User Output returned and any actions or steps taken by a Customer Agent.

**3.3.2 Agent Data.** Customer represents and warrants that it has all rights necessary to grant Retool the license to use Agent Data in accordance with the Agreement, and Retool’s processing of Agent Data as permitted hereunder will not (i) infringe, misappropriate, or violate any third-party rights; (ii) violate any applicable laws or regulations; or (iii) result in the breach of any terms or conditions Customer has with any third party.

## 4. End User Input, End User Output, and Agent Data

**4.1 Ownership.** Retool does not own nor will it claim ownership of End User Input, End User Output, or Agent Data.

**4.2 Use by Retool.** End User Input, End User Output, and Agent Data will be treated as Customer Data under the Agreement, and for the avoidance of any doubt, will not be used by Retool or by Retool's Sub-processors in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement. Retool will not permit the providers of Retool-Managed LLMs to train or fine-tune their respective models.

**4.3 Customer's Use of End User Output. Retool makes no warranty or guarantee as to the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or reliability of End User Output or the behavior of Customer Agents. End User Output may contain errors, inaccuracies, or content that could be offensive, unlawful, or otherwise inappropriate. Customer is solely responsible for reviewing,  evaluating and monitoring End User Output in connection with its use cases, including by employing human review and, if required, obtaining any required clearances. Human review may include pre-deployment testing, real-time supervision, or periodic auditing of End User Output, based on the risk level of the AI-Enabled Application. Customer must also provide disclosures to end users that any factual assertions in End User Output should not be relied upon without independent review. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, Retool will not be liable or responsible for Customer's use of End User Output or any omissions or errors in End User Output. Customer acknowledges and agrees that End User Output may not be unique to Customer.**

## 5. Indemnification

Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Retool and its Affiliates from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) by a third party arising from or relating to (i) an AI-Enabled Application or Customer Agent; (ii) Customer’s use of Retool AI in breach of these AI Terms or the Retool-Managed LLM Policies; or (iii) Retool’s processing of Agent Data in compliance with the Agreement, provided, however, that Customer will have no liability under Section 5(i) to the extent the claim arises from Retool’s breach of the Agreement or willful misconduct.

## 6. AI Beta Features

Retool may provide a version of Retool AI features or products on a free, trial, alpha, beta, preview, or early access basis ("**AI Beta Features**"). AI Beta Features are provided to Customer on an "AS IS" basis, without any warranties and without any performance, service level, or indemnification obligations. Retool will have no liability of any type with respect to AI Beta Features, unless such exclusion of liability is not enforceable under applicable laws, in which case Retool's total aggregate liability with respect to AI Beta Features is limited to $1,000 USD. Retool makes no commitments as to when AI Beta Features will be made available for general use. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Retool, Retool may discontinue or modify AI Beta Features, or revoke Customer's access to the same, at any time for any or no reason, without any liability to Customer. Discontinuing AI Beta Features, or making them inaccessible, may have the effect of making some or all of Customer Data inaccessible to Customer. If Retool decides to make an AI Beta Feature generally available, it may, upon reasonable notice to Customer, require payment of fees for continued use of such capability. Such fees will apply to Customer's use of the relevant feature as set forth in an Order Form.
