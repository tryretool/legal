---

This Retool Enterprise Support Policy (**"Policy"**) is subject to the terms and conditions between Retool and Customer, as referenced in the applicable Order Form (the **"Agreement"**). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Policy will have the definitions given to them in the Agreement.

## Applicability

This Policy describes Retool's support offering for tickets related to the Services and submitted by Customer to Retool via the Retool Help Portal (**"Support Tickets"**). **"Retool Help Portal"** means the support portal located at (https://help.retool.com) or such other successor URL (the "Retool Help Portal"). This Policy only applies if Customer has purchased an "Enterprise" level subscription to the Services under the applicable Order Form.

## Retool Support

At all times during the subscription term of the Order Form Retool will maintain a sufficient number of personnel who are experienced knowledgeable and qualified in the use and support of the Services. Retool will respond to Support Tickets as set forth in this Policy. All support pursuant to this Policy will be performed remotely and in the English language.

## Priority Levels

At the time of submitting its Support Ticket Customer will have the ability to designate the priority level of its request in the Retool Help Portal. Retool may reassign the priority level provided that such reassignment follows criteria set forth in the table below.

| Priority Level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Example Issues                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|     **P0**     | An emergency condition which makes the continued use of any production use cases depending on the Services impossible or significantly impaired. The condition requires an immediate solution that is not already available to Customer. | <ul><li>All Authorized Users are locked out of the primary workspace of Retool.</li><li>An important production Workflow is suddenly malfunctioning.</li></ul>                                                           |
|     **P1**     | Any condition which makes configuration of any one or more functions of the Services impossible and which Customer cannot reasonably circumvent or avoid on a temporary basis without the expenditure of significant time or effort.     | <ul><li>Resource credentials on development instances of Retool are suddenly unusable.</li><li>Part of the Retool editor UI is crashing.</li></ul>                                                                       |
|     **P2**     | Limited problem conditions which can be reasonably circumvented on a temporary basis without significant expenditure of time or effort or unclear configuration blockers needing troubleshooting to identify potential product fault.    | <ul><li>A bug report of odd drag & drop behavior inside of the editor in inconsistent scenarios.</li><li>A newly configured query behaves differently when run from Retool than directly against the database.</li></ul> |
|     **P3**     | A minor problem condition or Documentation error which Customer can easily circumvent or avoid. Suggestions for new Service features or enhancements are also classified as Priority Level 3.                                            | <ul><li>Requests for documentation or examples of how to configure a Retool feature.</li><li>All other non-product inquiries.</li></ul>                                                                                  |
