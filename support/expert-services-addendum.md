Applicable to all customers.

  This Expert Services Addendum (this **"Addendum"**) governs Retool's provision of any Expert Services (as defined
  below) under an Order Form. This Addendum is incorporated into and made subject to the terms and conditions
  between Retool and Customer that govern Customer's use of the Services (the **"Agreement"**). Capitalized terms
  used but not otherwise defined in this Addendum will have the meanings given to them in the Agreement.

## 1. Expert Services

**1.1."Expert  Services"**  means  ancillary  services  offered  by  Retool  to  facilitate,  accelerate  or  optimize
Customer's use of the Services under the Agreement. Depending on the level of support that Customer requires
from Retool, Expert Services may include enablement and advisory services (e.g., instructor-led training), Service
configuration, and/or development of Custom Apps on Customer's behalf. For the purposes of this Addendum,
Expert Services will not include the Services.

**1.2.Statements  of  Work;  Change  Orders.**  With  respect  to  all  Expert  Services  performed  under  this
Addendum, the parties will mutually agree on the scope, the parties' respective roles and responsibilities, and the
Expert Services fees (or Retool's hourly rates if provided on a time-and-materials basis), all of which will be set
forth in the applicable Order Form and a statement of work that is either referenced in the Order Form or
separately executed by the parties (**"SOW"**). Any changes to the scope of Expert Services and any corresponding
changes to fees must be mutually agreed to by the parties in the form of a written amendment.

## 2. Retool Responsibilities

**2.1.Performance.** Subject to Customer's compliance with Section 3 below, Retool will provide the Expert
Services (i) in accordance with the terms of this Addendum and the applicable Order Form and SOW; and (ii) in
compliance with laws and regulations applicable to Retool in its performance of the Expert Services. Unless
otherwise specified in the SOW, all Expert Services will be performed by Retool remotely.

**2.2.Expert Services Warranty.** Retool warrants that it will perform the Expert Services in a professional and
workmanlike manner consistent with applicable industry standards.

**2.3.Subcontractors.** Retool may use subcontractors to assist in its provision of the Expert Services unless the
applicable SOW restricts the use of subcontractors. To the extent Retool uses subcontractors to assist in its
provision of the Expert Services, Retool will be responsible for the performance of such subcontractors and their
compliance with Retool's obligations under this Addendum.

## 3. Customer Responsibilities

**3.1.Good Faith Cooperation.** Customer acknowledges and agrees that Retool's ability to timely perform
Expert  Services  requires  Customer's  active  engagement  and  good-faith  cooperation  throughout  the  Expert
Services. This includes, without limitation (i) assigning a competent project leader who will serve as the primary
point of contact throughout the Expert Services; (ii) providing feedback and answering questions in a timely
manner; (iii) attending and actively participating in scheduled meetings; and (iv) complying with other obligations
applicable to the specific Expert Services purchased by Customer, as set forth in the applicable SOW.

**3.2.Customer  Materials.**  "Customer  Materials"  means  any  materials,  resources,  documentation,
instructions, or specifications provided by Customer to Retool in connection with Retool's performance of the
Expert Services. Retool may require specific Customer Materials in order to perform the Expert Services and will
not be responsible for any delays caused by Customer's failure to provide such materials in a timely manner.
Customer grants Retool the limited right and license to use Customer Materials during the applicable SOW Term
solely as necessary to provide the Expert Services to Customer as described in the applicable SOW.

**3.3.Ownership of Customer Materials; Confidentiality.** Except as set forth in Section 3.2 above, Customer
retains  and owns all  right,  title,  and interest in and to the Customer Materials. Customer Materials will be
considered as Customer's Confidential Information under the Agreement.

## 4. Deliverables; Retool Technology

**4.1.Customer License for Deliverables.** Customer acknowledges and agrees that any deliverables shared
with or made available to Customer in connection with the Expert Services are solely to be used with or for the
Services  and  do  not have any use or application separate from the Services (**"Deliverables"**). Retool grants
Customer a worldwide, non-exclusive and non-transferrable right and license to use the Deliverables solely with
the Services.  If  Deliverables  include  or  incorporate  **"Retool  Technology"**  (as  defined below), Retool grants
Customer a worldwide, non-exclusive and non-transferrable right and license to use the Retool Technology solely
as incorporated in the Deliverables. If any Expert Services will include Retool creating any Deliverables that
do not include or incorporate any Retool Technology, any additional right, title, and interest in and to such
Deliverables beyond those granted to Customer in this Addendum may be specified in the applicable SOW.

4.2. **Retool Technology.** **"Retool Technology"** means (i) intellectual property owned or licensed by Retool
prior  to,  or  independent  of,  Retool's performance of the Expert Services (**"Retool Background IP"**), (ii) all
Intellectual Property and know-how applicable to the Services, and (iii) tools, code, materials, documentation,
reports and technology developed in connection with the Expert Services that have general application to Retool's
other customers, including derivatives of and improvements to Retool Background IP. Retool Technology will not
include Customer Materials, Customer's Confidential Information or Customer Data.

## 5. Fees and Payment

**5.1.Fees and Payment.** Fees for the Expert Services, or Retool's hourly rates for Expert Services performed on
a time-and-materials basis, will be specified in the applicable Order Form. All terms under the Agreement relating
to the invoicing and payment of fees,  the parties' respective tax obligations, and Retool's rights if Customer
is past due on invoiced amounts will apply to Expert Services fees. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and,
except as expressly set forth herein, fees paid are non-refundable.

## 6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

**6.1.** EXCEPT  AS  EXPRESSLY  SET  FORTH  IN  THIS  ADDENDUM,  RETOOL  DISCLAIMS  ALL  WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED,  RELATED  TO  THE  EXPERT  SERVICES,  INCLUDING  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  ANY
