Applicable to customers on the Enterprise plan.

:::

This Retool Support Policy ("**Policy**") is subject to the terms and conditions between Retool and Customer, as referenced in the applicable Order Form (the "**Agreement**"). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Policy will have the definitions given to them in the Agreement.

## Applicability

This Policy describes Retool's support services under the following Support Plans:

* Enterprise Support (applicable if Customer has purchased an "Enterprise" level Services subscription under the current Order Form)
* Premium Support (applicable if Customer has purchased the "Premium Support" subscription under the current Order Form)

## Retool Support

At all times during the subscription term of the Order Form, Retool will maintain a sufficient number of personnel who are experienced, knowledgeable, and qualified in the use and support of the Services. Retool will respond to Customer's support tickets related to the Services, which must be submitted by Customer to a Retool Support Channel ("**Support Tickets**"), in accordance with this Policy. All support by Retool will be performed remotely and in the English language.

The Retool Support Channels available to Customer will depend on Customer's current Support Plan:

| Retool Support Channel                                                                                           | Enterprise Support | Premium Support |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------: | :-------------: |
| Retool Help Portal (located at [help.retool.com](http://help.retool.com/app/portal) or such other successor URL) |         √          |        √        |
| Slack Support Channel                                                                                            |   Not available    |        √        |

### Slack Support Channel

Customers with the Premium Support Plan have the option to create Support Tickets via an integration in a Slack Connect shared channel connected to Retool's Slack Organization. If Retool receives a Support Ticket for the same issue in both the Help Portal and the Slack Support Channel, Retool will be permitted to close one of the tickets provided that assistance resumes in the other channel. To ensure streamlined communication and efficient responses, Retool recommends using one channel when submitting Support Tickets for each issue.

## Support Hours and Regions

Retool's support hours are based on Customer's current Support Plan and the priority level of Customer's request.

|                         | Enterprise Support                                                                       | Premium Support                               |

## Priority Level Descriptions; Target Response Times

\*  "Target Response Time" means the time between Retool's receipt of any Customer message within a Support Ticket, including the initial submission, and Retool's next response via one of its personnel.
