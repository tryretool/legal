## 2. PROCESSING OF RELEVANT PERSONAL DATA

### 2.1 Customer Obligations

Customer shall, in its use of the Services and provision of the Instructions, Process Relevant Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws. Customer shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Relevant Personal Data and the means by which Customer acquired such Relevant Personal Data.

### 2.2 Retool’s Processing of Relevant Personal Data. 

As Customer’s Processor, Retool shall only Process Relevant Personal Data for the following purposes: 

* Processing in accordance with the Agreement and applicable Order Form(s);
* Processing initiated by Authorised Users in their use of the Services; and
* Processing to comply with the Instructions, and Retool shall immediately inform Customer if, in Retool’s opinion, Customer’s Instructions infringe Applicable EU Law. 

Retool shall ensure that all Retool personnel (including employees, agents, contractors and subcontractors) who Retool authorises to Process any Relevant Personal Data have entered into appropriate contractually-binding confidentiality obligations.

### 2.3 Details of the Processing. 

The Parties acknowledge and agree that Schedule 1 (Description of Processing Activities) to this DPA is an accurate description of the Processing carried out under this DPA.

## 3. SUB-PROCESSORS

### 3.1 Appointment of Sub-processors. 

Customer acknowledges and agrees that:

* Retool’s Affiliates may be retained as Sub-processors through written agreement with Retool; and
* Retool and Retool’s Affiliates respectively may engage third-party Sub-processors in connection with the provision of the Services. 

As a condition to permitting a third-party Sub-processor to Process Relevant Personal Data, Retool or a Retool Affiliate will enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations that provide at least the same level of protection for Relevant Personal Data as those in this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature of the Services provided by such Sub-processor. Customer agrees that Retool may appoint Sub- processors in accordance with clause 3.2 below.

### 3.2 List of Current Sub-processors and Notification of New Sub-processors. 

A current list of Sub- processors for the Services, including the identities of those Sub-processors and their country of location, is accessible via https://docs.retool.com/docs/subprocessors (the “Sub-processor List”). Customer hereby consents to these Sub-processors, their locations and Processing activities as it pertains to Relevant Personal Data. The Sub-processor List contains a mechanism to subscribe to notifications of new Sub-processors, and if Customer subscribes, shall provide notification of new Sub-processor(s) before authorising such new Sub-processor(s) to Process Relevant Personal Data in connection with the provision of the applicable Services.

### 3.3 Objection Right for New Sub-processors. 

Customer may reasonably object to Retool’s use of a new Sub-processor (e.g., if making Relevant Personal Data available to the Sub-processor may violate Data Protection Laws or weaken the protections for such Relevant Personal Data) by notifying Retool promptly in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of Retool’s notice in accordance with the mechanism set out in clause 3.2. Such notice shall explain the reasonable grounds for the objection. In the event Customer objects to a new Sub-processor, as permitted in the preceding sentence, Retool will use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Relevant Personal Data by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably burdening Customer. If Retool is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, either party may terminate without penalty the applicable Order Form(s) with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Retool without the use of the objected-to new Sub-processor by providing written notice to Retool. Retool will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Order Form(s) following the effective date of termination with respect to such terminated Services, without imposing a penalty for such termination on Customer.

### 3.4 Liability. 

Retool shall be liable for the acts and omissions of its Sub-processors to the same extent Retool would be liable if performing the Services of each Sub-processor directly under the terms of this DPA.

## 4 REQUESTS FOR RELEVANT PERSONAL DATA

### 4.1 Data Subject Requests. 

Retool shall, to the extent legally permitted, promptly notify Customer if Retool receives a Data Subject Request. Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Retool shall assist Customer by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of Customer’s obligation to respond to a Data Subject Request as required by Data Protection Laws. In addition, to the extent Customer, in its use of the Services, does not have the ability to address a Data Subject Request, Retool shall, upon Customer’s request, provide commercially reasonable efforts to assist Customer in responding to such Data Subject Request, to the extent that Retool is legally permitted to do so and the response to such Data Subject Request is required under Data Protection Laws. To the extent legally permitted, Customer shall be responsible for any costs arising from Retool’s provision of such assistance, including any fees associated with the provision of additional functionality.

### 4.2 Regulator Correspondence. 

Retool shall promptly notify Customer on receipt of any Regulator Correspondence or Third Party Request, unless Retool is prohibited from so notifying Customer by applicable law. Retool will not disclose any Relevant Personal Data in response to such Regulator Correspondence or Third Party Request without first consulting with, and obtaining, Customer’s prior written authorisation, unless legally compelled to do so.

## 5. SECURITY

### 5.1 Security Measures. 

Retool shall maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures for the protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Relevant Personal Data (including protection against unauthorised or unlawful Processing and against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or damage, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Relevant Personal Data), as set forth in the Security Practices Page. Retool regularly monitors compliance with these measures. Retool will not materially decrease the overall security of the Services during a subscription term.

### 5.2 Security Incidents. 

Retool shall notify Customer without undue delay of any Security Incident. Any such notification by Retool to Customer of a Security Incident shall contain the following information, but only to the extent that Retool has details of same: (i) a description of the nature of the Security Incident (including, where possible, the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and data records concerned); (ii) the details of a contact point where more information concerning the Security Incident can be obtained; and (iii) its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the Security Incident, including to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Customer agrees that Retool may provide the foregoing information in phases. Retool shall provide commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance in identifying the cause of such Security Incident and shall take commercially reasonable steps to remediate the cause to the extent the remediation is within Retool’s control. Except as required by Data Protection Laws, the obligations herein shall not apply to incidents that are caused by Customer, Authorised Users and/or any Non-Retool Products.

## 6. RECORD-KEEPING

### 6.1 Third-Party Certifications and Audits. 

Retool has obtained the third-party certifications and audits set forth in the Security Practices Page. Upon Customer’s request, and subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement, Retool shall make available to Customer (or Customer’s independent, third-party auditor) information regarding Retool’s compliance with the obligations set forth in this DPA in the form of the third-party certifications and audits set forth in the Security Practices Page. Retool shall also permit and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by this DPA, at reasonable intervals or: (a) if there are indications, in Customer’s reasonable opinion, of non-compliance with this DPA; (b) where requested by a Supervisory Authority. To this end, Customer may contact Retool in accordance with notice provisions in the Agreement to request an on-site audit of Retool’s procedures relevant to the protection of Relevant Personal Data, but only to the extent required under Data Protection Laws. Before the commencement of any such on-site audit, Customer and Retool shall mutually agree upon the scope, timing, and duration of the audit, in addition to the reimbursement rate for which Customer shall be responsible. Customer shall reimburse Retool for any time expended for any such on-site audit at the Retool Group’s then-current rates, which shall be made available to Customer upon request. All reimbursement rates shall be reasonable, taking into account the resources expended by Retool. Customer shall promptly notify Retool with information regarding any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit, and Retool shall use commercially reasonable efforts to address any confirmed non-compliance.

### 6.2 Data Protection Impact Assessment. 

Where applicable and upon Customer’s request, Retool shall provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance needed to fulfil Customer’s obligation under the GDPR to carry out a data protection impact assessment related to Customer’s use of the Services, to the extent Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant information, and to the extent such information is available to Retool. Retool shall provide reasonable assistance to Customer in cooperation or prior consultation with the Supervisory Authority, to the extent required under the GDPR.
